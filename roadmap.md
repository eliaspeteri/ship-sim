# Roadmap TODOs

- [ ] Roles & permissions
  - Define cumulative roles: Guest (unauth, spectator only), Spectator (auth, spectator only), Player (auth, join/create vessels; default for new users), Admin (kick/ban/demote/promote, update environment/time, mute chat).
  - Enforce role checks across API/server and gate UI access for spectator vs play modes.
  - Seed default roles and assign Player on registration.
- [ ] Modes
  - Spectator mode: elevated free camera with WASD/arrow movement and rotation; water plane follows user with larger radius; can view vessels and join if role allows; does not send vessel updates.
  - Player mode: current sim for joining/creating vessels, crew visibility, and chat readiness; robust mode switching for vessel membership.
- [ ] Vessel join/create UX
  - Prompt new users to choose between creating their own vessel or joining an available crew slot (respect max crew), instead of auto-assigning.
  - Surface crew list for the active vessel in the HUD; add a basic vessel-local chat.
  - Add spawn picker (ports/anchors) when creating a vessel.
  - Persist crew chat history in the database and replay recent messages on join.
- [ ] Layout component
  - Shared navbar (home, sim, login, register) with room for future pages such as a 2D tiling map of active vessels.
- [ ] UI overhaul
  - Replace Tailwind-heavy styling with a custom or alternative styling approach; refresh HUD/layout components for clarity and responsiveness.
- [ ] Environment controls
  - Rebuild the EnvironmentControls UI to reflect the current server-driven weather model, admin gating, and live updates; remove obsolete toggles.
- [ ] Controls & ballast
  - Expose ballast control in the UI, wire to physics, and show feedback/state.
  - Expand helm/crew roles (e.g., helm/engine/radio) to avoid control conflicts.
- [ ] Instrumentation & observability
  - Add basic metrics (loop timing, socket/API latency) and central log aggregation for server and sim loops.
- [ ] Default vessels
  - On server boot, load saved vessels; if none, spawn an AI-controlled vessel at a default lat/long/heading and publish to clients.
- [ ] Position data
  - Refactor x/y to lat/long; keep height/depth; update physics, rendering, and network schemas.
- [ ] Auth review
  - Audit NextAuth flow so the server receives auth/role on every request; align JWT/cookie handling and role mapping.
- [ ] Auth hardening
  - Add logout endpoint/UI, rate limiting/lockout, and refresh/token rotation audit.
- [ ] Persistence
  - Confirm DB choice (Prisma/Postgres vs alternative) and persist users, vessels, environment state, bans/mutes, and chat history.
- [ ] Persistence polish
  - Add migrations/seed data for default roles/vessels and a backup/restore plan.
- [ ] Frontend tests
  - Add unit coverage and a smoke e2e (login → start sim → basic movement).
- [ ] Simulation UX
  - Add replay/ghost mode (record + playback), quick-start scenarios, and AI pilot on loss of control.
- [ ] Performance budgets
  - Profile WASM/renderer with targets for 60 Hz sim and smooth 3D rendering.
- [ ] Globe & ocean
  - Render globe with realistic ocean/land heightmap and bathymetry; ground ships when keel exceeds depth.
- [ ] Physics realism
  - Review AssemblyScript physics and improve hydrodynamics/environment forces without sacrificing stability.
  - Parameterize hydrodynamic constants per vessel (e.g., rudder stall angle/force coefficients) and pass them into WASM `createVessel`.
  - Wire Gerstner wave input (sea state → amplitude/steepness) into physics forces and renderer; ensure waves animate with correct phase and normals.
  - Add basic hull-form differentiation (block coefficient per vessel, draft/beam effects) and buoyancy/heave modeling.
- [ ] Missions & economy
  - Add mission system (deliveries, towing, harbor entries) with rewards and failure conditions.
  - Implement a simple economy: vessel operating costs, fuel consumption, port fees, and earnings tied to missions or cargo.
