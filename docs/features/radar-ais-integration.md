# Radar AIS Integration

## Goal
Integrate AIS (Automatic Identification System) target display into the radar system. AIS targets should be visually distinct from radar/ARPA targets, display basic information (MMSI, name, course, speed), and support interaction (e.g., tooltip or info on click/hover).

## Required Steps
1. Define AIS target data structure (MMSI, name, position, course, speed, etc.).
2. Update RadarDisplay to accept and render a list of AIS targets.
3. Draw AIS targets on the radar with a unique icon or color.
4. Show basic AIS info (MMSI, name, course, speed) on hover or click.
5. Add mock/test data and verify correct rendering.
6. Add documentation and types as needed.
7. Run lint and fix any issues.
